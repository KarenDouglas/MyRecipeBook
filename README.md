## General info

### Technologies
* JavaScript
* BootStrap 5
* HTML

### Functionality

#### * Adds Recipes
My Recipe Book allows users to add recipes with basic details : 'Title', 'Cook Time', 'Prep Time',' Meal Type', 'Instructions', 'Ingredients' and a 'Custom Title' .

#### * Searches for Recipes By Title
This app also allows users to search through their recipes by title.

#### * Shows Other methods for searching
This web page can also show users other methods to search: by Mealtype, or Cook Time. This feature merely shows the other options, instead of actually being able to search by these methods. ( I mainly made this feature to quench my curiousity about toggling in JavaScript)

## What I learned
In this project, I learned about:

* rendering elements based on objects
* dynamic property access and setting properties dynamically
* how to add filtering functionality
